Pre-requisites By default, the SPI kernel driver is NOT enabled on the Raspberry Pi Raspian 
image. Enable the SPI using GUI, you can follow the steps.
1. Select Preference from the raspberry pi application menu. 
2. From Preference select Raspberry Pi Configuration. 
3. Now form the Raspberry Pi Configuration window, navigate to Interfaces option. 
4. Enable radio button of SPI to enable it and click on OK. 
5. Reboot your raspberry pi after changing this setting.

Installing the Library Open the terminal window. Install the latest version of the library 
directly from PyPI by typing the following commands: 

$ sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-pip 
$ sudo pip3 install max7219 

Circuit Diagram: - (Take a picture of your circuit and paste below this)
We are using SPI protocol for wiring LED matrix module to raspberry pi, since it reduces 
the number pins required for wiring the circuit. 
1. Connect the VCC pin of 7219 driver board to Pin2 of raspberry pi.
2. Connect the Gnd pin of 7219 driver board to Pin6 of raspberry pi.
3. Connect the DIN pin of 7219 driver board to Pin19 of raspberry pi.
4. Connect the CS pin of 7219 driver board to Pin24 of raspberry pi.
5. Lastly, connect the CLK Pin of 7219 driver board to Pin23 of raspberry pi.
